       <h1><u>How I Started My Tech Career</u></h1>
       <p><p1>When I was 19 my dad enrolled me into an intensive computer training based on Hardware Engineering.</p1>
          <p2> It was awesome. So I studied to an extent I said: I am adding another learnings again. This was when I began scanning through websites and I discovered amazing ones. So I said let me try this. Now am in the pursuit for Web Development(Front-end).</p2>
           <p3> Actually I am still learning HTML which is the basis. I would absolutely be happy to be welcomed to the Dev Community.</p3>
